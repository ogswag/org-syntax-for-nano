# Org Mode syntax highlighting for the GNU Nano text editor.

I made this because I needed it. I'm sharing it with the world, so everyone can struggle less.

P.S. I really don't like using GNU Nano, but sometimes life makes me. If you're reading this it's probably a good idea to use Micro, Vim, Emacs, or another more powerful text editor.
